## Objective: 
- Create a strategic plan framework that can be implemented by all LCAs

## Purpose: 
- Establish best practices
- Employ a systematic approach to create administrative efficiencies
   - Ease GDA Compliance
   - Collaborate to define and implement effective administration of NSDI Themes
   - Facilitate Reporting
   - Reduce OIG Audit Burdens

## Strategies / Requirements
- Not all LCAs have the same resources. The Strategic Plan is deliberately focused on meeting what the law requires; Nothing more.
- LCAs wishing to go beyond the law can add supplementary Goals, Objectives, and Actions
- The template needs to be flexible to meet unique and diverse needs but rigid enough to address common GDA requirements.
- Compartmentalization will foster flexibility while allowing a common framework.
- Goals, Objective, and Activities focus on section 2805 paragraph b (ยง2805(b)) of the GDA which already incorporates many NSDI Goals, Objectives, and Actions
